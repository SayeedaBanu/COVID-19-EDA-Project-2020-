# COVID‑19‑EDA‑Project 2020

**Exploratory Data Analysis of COVID‑19 (2020) using a realistic synthetic dataset**

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project involves conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a **synthetic COVID‑19 dataset** created to simulate the real-world structure and trends observed during the pandemic’s early 2020 outbreak. Although no real patient data was used, the dataset reflects realistic patterns in confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, age groups, and regional spread.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

- Generate a synthetic dataset that mirrors real COVID‑19 data characteristics.
- Explore temporal, demographic, and geographic patterns in the simulated data.
- Create visualizations to highlight trends, peak periods, and age-based impact.
- Demonstrate data analysis and storytelling without compromising privacy.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**: Data manipulation and computation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**: Plotting trends and distribution charts
